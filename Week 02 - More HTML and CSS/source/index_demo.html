<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Typically included as the first line in every HTML file -->
<html> <!-- This notifies the browser that html is included (most browsers include this by default) -->
    <head> <!-- Any page metadata, like scripts to link to etc -->
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <!--
            Again, default value, but if omitted, the page might be vulnerable to XSS iframe-based attacks. Example resource:
            https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet#meta-charset-utf7
        -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/style.css" media="screen"/>
        <!--
            If you forget to include "type" as above, you might encounter an "unrecognised MIME" error in case of a strict server protocol of operation.

            "href" points to the CSS file (here using a relative path). If we omit the ".", and start with a "/" then we imply an absolute path (which, possibly, is invalid). If we omit all the "./" prefix we imply that we are looking for a subdirectory of the Currently Working Directory.

            The "media" parameter informs the browser about the target media type (might also be "print", for example).

        <title>
            XYZ University
        </title>
        <!-- 
            The title tag is the content visible on the browser tab and also crawled by search engines, so this also affects a website's SEO.
        -->
    </head>
    <body> <!-- This is where the main page content lives in -->
        <p> <!-- The paragraph tag, intended for... paragraphs of text -->
            Hello, World!
        </p>
